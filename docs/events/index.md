The Kenya Scouts events are further subdivided into different departments i.e.
- Youth Programme

## Youth Programme Department

The department works towards providing a vibrant programme that responds to the needs and aspirations of the youth. The youth programme is very dynamic to offer significant challenges in meeting youths ever-changing needs and desires. It guides, directs, educates, informs and seeks to mould young men and women into thoughtful yet critical members of society.
